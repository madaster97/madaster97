# Note Taking:
Structure and intention!

Understand through writing

Kanban of interesting ideas somewhere?

Create wikis: But my own stuff is mine! No touchy

Example: BWC Ian perspective notes

## What I've Done
- Installed Marksman VSCode extension
- Installed Pandoc (no VSCode extension just CLI it)
- Have VSCode previewing MD 

Example: Want the symbolpage hash code? OneNote > General > Link > Find the page 

### Marksman
Remember .marksman.toml!\
Check out their [features](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/blob/main/docs/features.md#workspace-folders-project-roots-and-single-file-mode)\
[Config available](https://github.com/artempyanykh/marksman/blob/main/Tests/default.marksman.toml) includes *title_from_heading*
Remember *Ambiguous link to document* - Default config is not allow multiple top-level headings
_TODO_ - Figure out reference links + how to view/navigate + wiki linking

> I have a directory structure based on the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), but I also have a large Zettelkasten directory where I put anything that does not necessary belong to a category.

> I recommend [this article](https://rwx.gg/lang/md/) about the benefits and merits of using markdown for note-taking.


### PARA method
*Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive*

You have *projects* you’re actively working on – short-term efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind.

You have areas of *responsibility* – important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention. These might include:

Then you have *resources* on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about...

Finally, you have archives, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active, but you might want to save for future reference:
- Projects you’ve completed or put on hold
- Areas that are no longer active or relevant
- Resources that you’re no longer interested in

It may be difficult to believe that a complex, modern human life like yours can be reduced to just four categories. It may feel like you have far more to deal with than can fit into such a simple system.
But that is exactly the point: if your organizational system is as complex as your life, then the demands of maintaining it will end up robbing you of the time and energy you need to live that life.

### Markdown Note Taking
Use Pandoc Markdown! Will have better mediawiki integration for sure (like nesting references to other docs)

### Pandoc Resources

### Neovim
*Didn't do this, just VSCode*

Combine Mischa's stuff with this neovim on windows article (like glyphs!)

Consider Marksman LSP vs this Pandoc plugin?
